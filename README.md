# Writing in silicone

silicone works in variables so you can reference a class and add info to that variable using that class.
example: let nineten = new person("nineten", 100, "programmer");

You should probaly be using let because if a persons age changes you have to uset he age changing method.
example: nineten.addAge(); (this makes nineten's age 101)
